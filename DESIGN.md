# PRISM Utility Design System

## 1. Atmosphere & Identity

PRISM Utility is an operational Windows workstation for scanner bring-up and profile authoring. It should feel calm, dense, and trustworthy: the surface is a Fluent command center where hardware-facing tools and offline editors share the same measured rhythm. The signature is restrained card-based instrumentation: compact sections, visible state banners, and persistent actions that never hide critical validation behind modals.

## 2. Color

### Palette

| Role | Token | Source | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App surface | `ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Page background and shell content area. |
| Card surface | `CardBackgroundFillColorDefaultBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Section cards and elevated panels. |
| Card stroke | `CardStrokeColorDefaultBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Card borders, preview wells, and quiet separators. |
| Text primary | `TextFillColorPrimaryBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Page titles, section titles, form labels. |
| Text secondary | `TextFillColorSecondaryBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Descriptions, helper text, summaries, empty states. |
| Accent action | `AccentButtonStyle` / system accent resources | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Primary action only: start, save, apply. |
| Critical action | `SystemFillColorCriticalBrush` | WinUI Fluent theme resource | Stop/destructive outlines and error emphasis. |
| Success, warning, error, info | `InfoBarSeverity` | WinUI Fluent control state | Operation and validation banners. |

### Rules

- Use WinUI theme resources for all colors; do not introduce raw hex, RGB, or package-specific color systems in XAML.
- Status color appears through `InfoBar`, command enablement, or existing theme brushes. Do not create decorative color chips.
- Disabled state is the native Fluent disabled state plus nearby explanatory text when the blocked action is important.

## 3. Typography

### Scale

| Level | Token/style | Source | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page title | `TitleTextBlockStyle` / `PageTitleStyle` | WinUI Fluent + `Styles/TextBlock.xaml` | Top-level page headings. |
| Section title | `SubtitleTextBlockStyle` | WinUI Fluent | Card and region headings. |
| Field group title | `BodyStrongTextBlockStyle` | WinUI Fluent | Metadata, acquisition, recipe, channel subgroup labels. |
| Body | `BodyTextBlockStyle` / default TextBlock | WinUI Fluent | Form descriptions and normal copy. |
| Secondary body | Local quiet text style with `TextFillColorSecondaryBrush` | Existing Scan/Log pages | Helper text, inline summaries, validation detail. |
| Data caption | `CaptionTextBlockStyle` or 12px body only inside compact status badges | WinUI Fluent / existing Scan Debug exceptions | Dense numeric hints and limits. |

### Font Stack

- Primary: the WinUI system font stack, rendered through Fluent typography resources.
- Icon font: `SymbolThemeFontFamily` for shell/navigation icon glyphs only.
- No external fonts or icon packages are allowed.

### Rules

- Preserve existing Fluent typography resources instead of adding page-specific font sizes.
- Use `TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords"` for descriptions, validation, and CJK-sensitive copy. Reserve `NoWrap` plus ellipsis for one-line status summaries only.

## 4. Spacing & Layout

### Base Unit

All page-local spacing derives from the existing 4px grid, with operational defaults of 8px, 12px, and 24px.

| Token | Value | Source | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tight | 4px | Existing inline status badges and captions | Caption-to-detail spacing. |
| Inline | 8px | `XSmallTopMargin`, page-local `InlineSpacing` | Field rows, button groups, helper text spacing. |
| Section | 12px | `SmallTopMargin`, Scan/Log card spacing | Card gaps, row/column gaps, page header gap. |
| Comfortable | 24px | `MediumTopMargin`, `NavigationViewPageContentMargin` | Page-level and major region separation. |
| Large | 36px | `LargeTopMargin` | Rare major settings breaks only. |

### Responsive Thresholds

| Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constrained logical width | below 960px | Stack editor and review/sidebar sections into one vertical scroll path. |
| Wide logical width | 960px and above | Use editor plus validation/staged/channel sidebar columns when useful. |
| Review/sidebar width | 360px | Side column width for validation, staged import, and channel review on wide editor surfaces. |

### Grid

- Existing wide pages use 12px outer padding in full-bleed tool surfaces and `NavigationViewPageContentMargin` for shell pages.
- Dense tool pages use two-column desktop grids with a scrollable left rail and flexible work area.
- New editor pages must adapt: single-column at constrained logical widths, two-column content/side-summary at wide logical widths, with one vertical scroll path and no horizontal scrolling.

### Rules

- Prefer `Grid` with explicit row/column spacing for structured forms; use `WrapPanel` only for action groups that may wrap.
- Keep form fields aligned in 2-column rows at wide widths and stacked/wrapped in constrained widths.
- No arbitrary spacing values outside the documented 4/8/12/24 rhythm unless matching an existing shared resource.

## 5. Components

### Operational page header

- **Structure**: title and one-line status on the left, persistent command group on the right, progress or InfoBar below when needed.
- **Variants**: idle, busy, dirty, invalid, staged import, success, error.
- **Spacing**: 8px internal stack, 12px row/column gaps, 12px bottom margin.
- **States**: primary command uses `AccentButtonStyle`; disabled commands remain visible; busy state uses `ProgressRing`/`ProgressBar` and disabled commands.
- **Accessibility**: every command keeps visible text and a stable tab stop when enabled.
- **Motion**: native control state transitions only.

### Section card

- **Structure**: `Border` with `CardBackgroundFillColorDefaultBrush`, `CardStrokeColorDefaultBrush`, 1px border, 8px radius, 12px padding, containing a vertical `StackPanel`.
- **Variants**: neutral, validation warning/error via nested `InfoBar`, selected side-summary card via normal card stroke.
- **Spacing**: 8px inside field groups, 12px between sections.
- **States**: default, disabled child controls, empty, error, busy through child `InfoBar` or progress control.
- **Accessibility**: section title is visible text; controls use `x:Uid` headers or explicit accessible names.
- **Motion**: none beyond native Fluent focus/press transitions.

### Inline validation summary

- **Structure**: `InfoBar` for headline status plus grouped issue list with field path and actionable text.
- **Variants**: valid, warning, error, import-preview issues.
- **Spacing**: 8px between issue rows, 12px around summary cards.
- **States**: hidden when no issues; visible and keyboard-reachable when issues block save/apply.
- **Accessibility**: plain text paths and messages; do not rely on color alone.
- **Motion**: none.

### Staged import review

- **Structure**: compact card with imported profile summary and explicit Apply / Discard commands.
- **Variants**: no staged import, staged valid import, staged invalid import.
- **Spacing**: 8px content/action gaps.
- **States**: Apply disabled while busy or invalid; Discard remains available when staging exists and not busy.
- **Accessibility**: Apply and Discard are visible buttons, not modal-only choices.
- **Motion**: native control transitions only.

### Editable form group

- **Structure**: section title, helper copy, 2-column grid of `TextBox`, `ComboBox`, and `ToggleSwitch` controls.
- **Variants**: metadata, acquisition, scan recipe, selected channel profile.
- **Spacing**: 8px field gaps, 12px group gaps.
- **States**: default, dirty, invalid, disabled while busy.
- **Accessibility**: use localized headers/placeholders; validation appears inline near the form or in summary.
- **Motion**: none.

## 6. Motion & Interaction

### Timing

| Type | Duration | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native micro-interaction | WinUI default | Button hover, press, focus, toggle. |
| Busy feedback | Immediate | ProgressRing/ProgressBar becomes visible while async file operations run. |
| State banners | Immediate | Success/error/validation InfoBars open inline after the operation. |

### Rules

- Do not add decorative animation. This is an internal operational tool.
- Preserve visible keyboard focus through native controls.
- Keep New, Open, Validate, and Save discoverable as persistent page actions. Do not hide them inside menus.
- Malformed input must surface inline validation and never silently save or apply.

## 7. Depth & Surface

### Strategy

Depth uses mixed Fluent tonal shift plus 1px card borders. Shadows are not a primary separation mechanism in the existing app.

| Level | Token | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Base | app background theme brush | Page canvas. |
| Raised card | card background + card stroke + 8px radius | Editor sections, validation summary, staged import review. |
| System notice | `InfoBar` | Busy, success, warning, error, validation states. |
| Modal | `ContentDialog` | Hardware prompts or blocking confirmations only; avoid for routine editor validation. |

### Rules

- Use borders and tonal fills consistently; no custom shadows, glass, gradients, or decorative materials for this page.
- Preserve the existing Scan Debug card language while removing hardware-only controls from the editor.
- Responsive QA must check 100%, 150%, and 200% scaling or equivalent window sizes for clipping, focus visibility, and CJK wrapping.
